## --Discussion  

This project was a hands-on way to learn the basics of React. Using Vite to set up the project was straightforward, and Tailwind CSS made styling much easier than traditional CSS. I enjoyed creating reusable components, which helped me understand how React applications are structured.  

### Challenges:  
- Setting up Tailwind CSS for the first time was tricky, but following tutorials made it manageable.  
- Passing props was confusing at first, but I quickly understood its importance in making components dynamic.  

### Successes:  
- I successfully created and styled the `Header` and `GreetingCard` components.  
- Using props allowed each card to display unique titles and messages.  

By completing this project, I gained confidence in building React applications and styling them effectively.
